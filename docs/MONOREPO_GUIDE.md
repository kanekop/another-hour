# Monorepo Migration Status

## 🗓️ Last Updated: 2025-06-14

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### Phase 0: Preparation
- [x] Repository renamed: `another-hour-scheduler` → `another-hour`
- [x] Created `monorepo-migration` branch
- [x] Completed migration and merged to main
- [x] Deleted migration branch

### Phase 1: Basic Structure (Partially Complete)
- [x] Created packages directory structure
- [x] Moved scheduler to `packages/scheduler-web/`
- [x] Created root package.json with workspaces
- [x] Updated scheduler package name to `@another-hour/scheduler-web`
- [x] Verified application works on Replit
- [ ] Create `@another-hour/core` package
- [ ] Extract common logic from scheduler
- [ ] Add tests for core functionality

## 📊 Current Structure

```
another-hour/
├── packages/
│   └── scheduler-web/      ✅ Moved and working
│       ├── public/
│       │   └── clock-core.js  (contains shared logic to extract)
│       ├── src/
│       ├── server.js
│       └── package.json
├── docs/
├── package.json           ✅ Workspace configured
└── README.md
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks (Phase 1 Completion)

1. **Create Core Package**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p packages/core/src
   cd packages/core
   npm init -y
   # Set name to "@another-hour/core"
   ```

2. **Extract Common Logic**
   - From: `packages/scheduler-web/public/clock-core.js`
   - To: `packages/core/src/time-calculation.js`
   - Key functions to extract:
     - `getCustomAhAngles()`
     - `convertToAHTime()`
     - Time scaling calculations

3. **Update Dependencies**
   ```json
   // packages/scheduler-web/package.json
   "dependencies": {
     "@another-hour/core": "workspace:*"
   }
   ```

4. **Test Everything**
   - Ensure scheduler still works
   - Verify core functions are accessible

### Future Phases

- **Phase 2**: Add clock-web package
- **Phase 3**: Add watch-app package
- **Phase 4**: Implement Time Design Modes

## 🔧 Commands Reference

```bash
# Install dependencies (from root)
npm install

# Run scheduler
npm run start

# Run from specific package
npm run start --workspace=@another-hour/scheduler-web
```

## 📌 Important Notes

- Google Calendar OAuth only works on Replit (not local)
- Small issues noted in scheduler, but functional
- All existing features preserved during migration
