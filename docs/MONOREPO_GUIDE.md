## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks (Phase 1 Completion)

1.  **Add Tests for Core Package**
    -   Set up a testing framework (e.g., Jest).
    -   Write unit tests for `getCustomAhAngles` in `packages/core/src/time-calculation.js`.
    -   Ensure calculations are correct for various scenarios.

### Future Phases

- **Phase 2**: Add clock-web package
- **Phase 3**: Add watch-app package
- **Phase 4**: Implement Time Design Modes

## 🔧 Commands Reference

```bash
# Install dependencies (from root)
npm install

# Run scheduler
npm run start

# Run from specific package
npm run start --workspace=@another-hour/scheduler-web
```

## 📌 Important Notes

- Google Calendar OAuth only works on Replit (not local)
- Small issues noted in scheduler, but functional
- All existing features preserved during migration
