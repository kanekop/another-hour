# Development Guide

This guide provides instructions for setting up the development environment for the Another Hour project.

## Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v16.0.0 or higher)
-   npm (v7.0.0 or higher, comes with Node.js)

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kanekop/another-hour.git
cd another-hour
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

This project uses [NPM Workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/workspaces) to manage the monorepo. Running `npm install` from the root directory will install dependencies for all packages.

```bash
# From the project root
npm install
```

This will also install `lerna`, which is used for managing package versions and publishing.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Workflow

### Running the Main Application

To run the `scheduler-web` application, use the script defined in the root `package.json`.

```bash
# Runs the scheduler-web application
npm run dev
```

This command executes the `dev` script within the `@another-hour/scheduler-web` workspace.

### Running a Specific Package

If you need to run a command for a specific package, you can use the `--workspace` flag.

```bash
# Example: Run the 'test' script only for the 'scheduler-web' package
npm run test --workspace=@another-hour/scheduler-web
```

### Running a Command Across All Packages

To run a script across all packages that have it defined, use the `--workspaces` flag.

```bash
# Example: Run the 'lint' script in all packages
npm run lint --workspaces --if-present
```

## üß™ Testing

This project uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) as its testing framework. Tests are located in the `tests` directory within each package.

### Running All Tests

To run all tests across all packages, use the following command from the root directory:

```bash
npm test --workspaces
```

### Running Tests for a Specific Package

You can run tests for a single package using the `--workspace` flag. This is useful for focusing on a specific part of the codebase.

```bash
# Run all tests in the @another-hour/core package
npm test --workspace=@another-hour/core
```

### Running Tests in Watch Mode

During development, it's helpful to run tests in watch mode, which automatically re-runs tests when files change.

```bash
# Watch for changes and re-run tests in @another-hour/core
npm run test:watch --workspace=@another-hour/core
```

### Checking Test Coverage

The `@another-hour/core` package is configured to generate a test coverage report. After running the tests, you can find a detailed HTML report in `packages/core/coverage/lcov-report/index.html`.

```bash
# Run tests and generate a coverage report for the core package
npm run test:coverage --workspace=@another-hour/core
```

## üì¶ Package Management

### Adding a Dependency to a Specific Package

To add a new dependency to a package, use the `--workspace` flag with `npm install`.

```bash
# Example: Add 'date-fns' to the scheduler-web package
npm install date-fns --workspace=@another-hour/scheduler-web
```

### Adding a New Package

1.  Create a new directory under `packages/`.
2.  `cd` into the new directory.
3.  Run `npm init` to create a `package.json` file.
    -   Make sure to use the `@another-hour/` scope for the package name (e.g., `@another-hour/new-package`).
4.  Run `npm install` from the root directory to link the new package.

## üìù Coding Style

Please adhere to the existing coding style. We use Prettier and ESLint to maintain a consistent style (configuration to be added).

## üìÑ Documentation

All documentation is located in the `/docs` directory and is written in Markdown. Please keep documentation up-to-date with any changes you make.

  if (clickTimer) {
    // Double-click detected
    clearTimeout(clickTimer);
    clickTimer = null;
    showEventDetailsModal(event);
  } else {
    // Single-click - wait to see if double-click follows

- Modal animations use CSS transitions for better performance
- Consider virtual scrolling for very long time ranges
- Batch API calls when possible

### Browser Compatibility

- Modal uses flexbox for centering (IE11+ support)
- Double-click detection works across all modern browsers
- Test on Safari for iOS-specific issues

### Accessibility Improvements
- Modal includes keyboard navigation (ESC to close)
- Click-outside-to-close pattern for better UX
- Proper z-index management for modal layering
- Focus management considerations for future iterations

### Security Reminders
- OAuth tokens stored in server sessions
- Never expose client secrets
- Implement CSRF protection for state changes
