# Monorepo Migration Status

## 🗓️ Last Updated: 2025-06-14

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### Phase 0: Preparation
- [x] Repository renamed: `another-hour-scheduler` → `another-hour`
- [x] Created `monorepo-migration` branch
- [x] Completed migration and merged to main
- [x] Deleted migration branch
- [x] Verified application works on Replit

### Phase 1: Basic Structure
- [x] Create `@another-hour/core` package
- [x] Extract common logic from scheduler
- [x] Update scheduler-web to use core package
- [x] Troubleshoot and fix workspace dependency issues
- [x] Add tests for core functionality

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks (Phase 2 Start)

1.  **Add `clock-web` Package**
    -   Create a new package for the simple clock web application.
    -   Implement a basic UI to display the time using `@another-hour/core`.

### Future Phases

- **Phase 3**: Add watch-app package
- **Phase 4**: Implement Time Design Modes

## 🔧 Commands Reference

```bash
# Install dependencies (from root)
npm install

# Run scheduler
npm run start

# Run tests for a specific package
npm test --workspace=@another-hour/core

# Run all tests
npm test --workspaces
```

## 📌 Important Notes

- Google Calendar OAuth only works on Replit (not local)
- Small issues noted in scheduler, but functional
- All existing features preserved during migration
