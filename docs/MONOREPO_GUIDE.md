## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks (Phase 3)

1.  **Add `watch-app` Package**
    -   Create a new package for the watch application
    -   Design mobile-first interface
    -   Implement using `@another-hour/core`

### Future Phases

- **Phase 4**: Implement Time Design Modes
  - Add customizable time design patterns
  - Integrate across all applications
  - Create unified configuration system

## 🔧 Commands Reference

```bash
# Install dependencies (from root)
npm install

# Run scheduler
npm run start

# Run clock-web
npm run dev --workspace=clock-web

# Run website
npm run dev --workspace=website

# Run tests for a specific package
npm test --workspace=@another-hour/core

# Run all tests
npm test --workspaces
```

## 📌 Important Notes

- Google Calendar OAuth only works on Replit (not local)
- Small issues noted in scheduler, but functional
- All existing features preserved during migration
- Website package uses Astro framework with Tailwind CSS
- Multi-language support structure in place (ja/en)
