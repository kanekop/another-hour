# Another Hour

**Experience time differently. Make every hour count. ⏰**

Another Hour is a revolutionary platform that redefines your relationship with time. Instead of being bound by the mechanical 24-hour clock, you can design how time flows in your life.

## ✨ Core Philosophy

Time is not just a measurement—it's an experience. Another Hour allows you to:

- **Design Your Day**: Create a personalized 24-hour cycle that matches your lifestyle
- **Scale Time**: Make important hours last longer or compress routine periods
- **Find Balance**: Reserve "Another Hour" for what truly matters

## 🎨 Time Design Modes (NEW!)

### Classic Mode
The original Another Hour experience—reserve time at the end of your day for yourself.

### Core Time Mode 
Define your productive hours and surround them with peaceful "Another Hour" periods.

### Wake-Based Mode
Start your 24-hour cycle when YOU wake up, not at midnight.

### Solar Mode
Sync your time with nature—let sunrise and sunset define your rhythm.
