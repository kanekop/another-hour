# Project Structure

This document outlines the monorepo structure for the Another Hour project.

## Root Directory

The root directory contains configuration files for the entire monorepo and the `packages` and `docs` directories.

```
another-hour/
â”œâ”€â”€ packages/             -- Contains all individual packages (applications and libraries).
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/                 -- Contains all project documentation.
â”œâ”€â”€ .replit               -- Configuration for the Replit environment.
â”œâ”€â”€ lerna.json            -- Configuration for Lerna, the monorepo management tool.
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json          -- Root package file, defines workspaces and root scripts.
â””â”€â”€ README.md             -- Main project README.
```

## `packages/` Directory

This directory houses all the independent packages of the project, managed by NPM Workspaces and Lerna.

### `@another-hour/scheduler-web`

This is the main web application for the Another Hour scheduler.

-   **`public/`**: Contains all static assets like HTML, CSS, images, and client-side JavaScript.
    -   **`js/`**: Holds the UI logic for different parts of the application.
        -   **`time-design/`**: Contains the core logic for the different time design modes. This is a candidate for being extracted into its own `@another-hour/core` package.
-   **`src/`**: Contains server-side source code, primarily for handling API routes and backend logic.
-   **`server.js`**: The main entry point for the Node.js/Express server.
-   **`package.json`**: Defines dependencies and scripts specific to the `scheduler-web` application.

### (Future) `@another-hour/core`

This package will contain shared logic, constants, and utility functions used across multiple applications (e.g., `scheduler-web`, `watch-app`).

-   Time design mode calculations.
-   Common timezone utilities.
-   Shared data structures.

## `docs/` Directory

This directory contains all documentation for the project.

-   **`specifications/`**: Detailed technical specifications for core features and modes.
-   **`time-design-modes/`**: User-friendly explanations of how each time design mode works.
-   **`MONOREPO_GUIDE.md`**: This guide, explaining the structure and development workflow of the monorepo.
-   **`DEVELOPMENT.md`**: Instructions for setting up the development environment and running the project.

This structured approach allows for clear separation of concerns, easier dependency management, and better scalability as the project grows.

## ðŸ“‚ Top-Level Directory Guide

### `/` (Root)

-   `README.md`: The first stop for anyone new to the project. Contains a general overview and setup instructions.
-   `package.json`: Defines project metadata, dependencies, and scripts.
-   `server.js`: The main entry point for the Node.js backend server.

### `/docs`

This directory contains all project-related documentation.

-   `/docs/time-design-modes`: A crucial section containing the conceptual overview, technical specifications, and detailed guides for each Time Design Mode. This is the best place to understand the "why" and "how" behind the core logic.
    -   `/docs/time-design-modes/modes`: Contains deep-dive documents for each specific mode (`SolarMode`, `WakeBasedMode`, etc.), explaining their unique concepts and calculations.

### `/public`

Contains all static assets that are served directly to the client's browser. This is the heart of the frontend application.

-   `index.html`: The main landing page for the application.
-   `time-design-test.html`: The comprehensive test page used for developing and debugging the Time Design Modes system.
-   `/public/css`: Contains all CSS files for styling the application's various pages and components.
-   `/public/js`: The core of the client-side logic.
    -   `main.js`: The main entry point for the primary clock application.
    -   `time-design-test-main.js`: The entry point and UI logic specifically for the `time-design-test.html` page.
    -   `/public/js/time-design`: This is the most important directory for the core scheduling logic.
        -   `TimeDesignManager.js`: The central brain of the system. It manages the current mode, handles configuration changes, and performs the time calculations.
        -   `ModeRegistry.js`: Responsible for discovering and registering all available mode classes.
        -   `/public/js/time-design/modes`: Contains the individual class definitions for each mode.
            -   `BaseMode.js`: The abstract parent class that all other modes inherit from. Defines the common interface.
            -   `ClassicMode.js`, `CoreTimeMode.js`, etc.: The specific implementations for each mode, containing their unique configuration schema and calculation logic.

### `/src`

Contains server-side source code, primarily for backend services and APIs that might be needed in the future (e.g., for user accounts or calendar synchronization).
