# Monorepo Migration Status

## 🗓️ Last Updated: 2025-06-15

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### Phase 0: Preparation
- [x] Repository renamed: `another-hour-scheduler` → `another-hour`
- [x] Created `monorepo-migration` branch
- [x] Completed migration and merged to main
- [x] Deleted migration branch
- [x] Verified application works on Replit

### Phase 1: Basic Structure
- [x] Create `@another-hour/core` package
- [x] Extract common logic from scheduler
- [x] Troubleshoot and fix workspace dependency issues
- [x] Add tests for core functionality
- [x] Refactor `scheduler-web` to use `@another-hour/core`

### Phase 2: Clock Web Application
- [x] Create `clock-web` package
- [x] Implement basic UI to display time using `@another-hour/core`
- [x] Add responsive design and styling

### Additional Packages
- [x] Create `website` package
- [x] Implement Astro-based website with specifications
- [x] Add multi-language support structure

### Phase 3: Watch Application
- [x] Create `watch-app` package as a static PWA
- [x] Implement mobile-first UI with analog/digital modes
- [x] Refactor to remove server dependency

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks (Phase 4)

1.  **Implement Time Design Modes**
    -   Add customizable time design patterns to `@another-hour/core`
    -   Integrate across all applications (`scheduler`, `clock`, `watch`)
    -   Create a unified configuration system

### Future Phases
- Future features to be determined.

## 🔧 Commands Reference

```bash
# Install dependencies (from root)
npm install

# Run scheduler
npm run start

# Run clock-web
npm run dev --workspace=clock-web

# Run website
npm run dev --workspace=website

# Run watch-app (requires two terminals)
npm run dev --workspace=@another-hour/watch-app   # Terminal 1: Watch for changes
npm run start --workspace=@another-hour/watch-app # Terminal 2: Serve static files

# Run tests for a specific package
npm test --workspace=@another-hour/core

# Run all tests
npm test --workspaces
```

## 📌 Important Notes

- Google Calendar OAuth only works on Replit (not local)
- Small issues noted in scheduler, but functional
- All existing features preserved during migration
- Website package uses Astro framework with Tailwind CSS
- Multi-language support structure in place (ja/en)
